This app allows a manager to login and schedule his employees for work. The manager will be met with an auth screen backed up via firebase. Once they have logged in they will be met with a list of their employees. Managers have the option of adding employees or editing current employees. They also have the ability to text the employee their schedules. Finally they can fire the employee and get rid of them from the database.
